# Account Portfolio & Revenue Decision Support

## Overview
This project analyses an account portfolio to support revenue-focused decision-making within an account management context.

The objective is to help decision-makers understand where to prioritise effort, manage risk, and identify opportunities for sustainable growth.

## Business context
Account managers often oversee portfolios with limited time and resources, yet not all accounts contribute equally to revenue, growth, or strategic value.

This project reflects a scenario where leadership wants to:
- Prioritise high-value accounts
- Identify revenue risk early
- Allocate account management effort more effectively

## Key business question
Which accounts drive sustainable value, which are at risk, and how should account management effort be prioritised?

## Data & assumptions
The analysis uses account-level data such as:
- Revenue contribution
- Account activity or engagement indicators
- Portfolio distribution

Assumptions are clearly stated to reflect realistic business constraints rather than perfect data availability.

## Analytical approach
- Segment accounts based on revenue and performance indicators
- Compare value contribution against implied management effort
- Identify concentration risk and underperforming segments

The analysis focuses on **decision support**, not forecasting.

## Key insights
- A small proportion of accounts typically drive a disproportionate share of revenue
- Some high-effort accounts deliver limited commercial return
- Portfolio risk increases when revenue is overly concentrated

## Recommended actions
- Focus account management effort on high-value, growth-oriented accounts
- Review low-return accounts for restructuring or service model changes
- Use portfolio-level metrics to support resource planning decisions

## Tools used
- SQL and Python for analysis
- Excel-style portfolio reasoning
- Business analysis techniques

## Limitations & next steps
Future iterations could include:
- Time-based trend analysis
- Profitability rather than revenue focus
- Integration with client satisfaction metrics
